### When to Use Machine Learning

> Machine learning is an approach to (1) learn (2) complex patterns from (3) existing data and use these patterns to make (4) predictions on (5) unseen data.

1. Learn: the system has the capacity to learn
2. Complex patterns: there are patterns to learn, and they are complex
3. Existing data: data is available, or it’s possible to collect data
4. Predictions: it’s a predictive problem
5. Unseen data: unseen data shares patterns with the training data

6. It’s repetitive
7. The cost of wrong predictions is cheap
8. It’s at scale
9. The patterns are constantly changing

### Machine Learning Systems Versus Traditional Software

On the contrary, ML systems are part code, part data, and part artifacts created from the two. The trend in the last decade shows that applications developed with the most/best data win. Instead of focusing on improving ML algorithms, most companies will focus on improving their data. Because data can change quickly, ML applications need to be adaptive to the changing environment, which might require faster development and deployment cycles.
