### When to Use Machine Learning

> Machine learning is an approach to (1) learn (2) complex patterns from (3) existing data and use these patterns to make (4) predictions on (5) unseen data.

1. Learn: the system has the capacity to learn
2. Complex patterns: there are patterns to learn, and they are complex
3. Existing data: data is available, or it’s possible to collect data
4. Predictions: it’s a predictive problem
5. Unseen data: unseen data shares patterns with the training data
6. **It’s repetitive**
7. **The cost of wrong predictions is cheap**
8. **It’s at scale**
9. **The patterns are constantly changing**

### Machine Learning Systems Versus Traditional Software

On the contrary, ML systems are part code, part data, and part artifacts created from the two. The trend in the last decade shows that applications developed with the most/best data win. Instead of focusing on improving ML algorithms, most companies will focus on improving their data. Because data can change quickly, ML applications need to be adaptive to the changing environment, which might require faster development and deployment cycles.

### Business and ML Objectives

The ultimate goal of any project within a business is, therefore, to increase profits, either directly or indirectly: directly such as increasing sales (conversion rates) and cutting costs; indirectly such as higher customer satisfaction and increasing time spent on a website.

For an ML project to succeed within a business organization, it’s crucial to tie the performance of an ML system to the overall business performance.

Many companies create their own metrics to map business metrics to ML metrics.

### Requirements for ML Systems

1. Reliability
2. Scalability
3. Maintainability: ML engineers, DevOps engineers, and subject matter experts (SMEs)
4. Adaptability: Continual Learning
