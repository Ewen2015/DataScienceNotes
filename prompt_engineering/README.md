# Prompt Engineering

**Nature Languagre Processing (NLP)** just meets its **Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT)** time when **Transformer** and **Generative Pre-trainded Transformer (GPT)** came into the world.

- **GBDT** and its algorithm packages like XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost are pretty mature for **tabular data** problems.
- **GPT** and its applications are now much more ready-to-use for unstractured data for **NLP problems**.

Besides, **prompt engineering** to NLP is just like **feature engineering** to tablular data problems now. 

Some use cases with prompt engineering:

- **Summarizing**: summarizing user reviews for brevity
- **Inferring**: sentiment classification, topic extraction
- **Transforming text**: translation, spelling & grammar correction
- **Expanding**: automatically writing emails
